Math Coding and Analytics (MCA)

MCA is an innovative platform that aims to address Big Data challenges and issues in research and development (R&D) combining mathematics with coding and analytics. MCA also elaborates on conceptual frameworks to develop theoretically-based applications including tailored  applications involving machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) for rapid and timely actions

MCA Mission Statement

MCA’s mission is to help to address Big Data unprecedented growth to carry out pertinent analytics in the cloud and the edges and to help improve productivity, while helping people across sectors, to acquire new skills and develop innovative tools that are necessary for today’s and tomorrow’s jobs as the world of R&D is becoming increasingly digital.

MCA helps to address shortage in coding skills that transcends almost international boundaries!

MCA co-develops applications and tools to capture and analyze data along with the production of original publications. We combine mathematics, coding and analytics with publications of pertinent documents to make data analysis more effective for better insights. Finding patterns in large data sets of high-dimensional factors combining mathematics with coding and analytics can help in the predictions and rapid timely decision making, especially in light of rapid changing global conditions.
